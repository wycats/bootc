# Verifies that the upstream Bazzite image still provides the packages,
# services, and paths documented in base-image-assumptions.json.
# This catches breaking changes in upstream before they break our distribution.
#
# IMPORTANT: The "pristine check" runs BEFORE installing build deps to ensure
# we're testing what Bazzite actually provides, not what we install for building.
