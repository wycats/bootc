# Alignment Coherence Check

**Focus**: Fidelity to Goal (Intent).
**Grimoire Mapping**: `razor` (Conceptual Razor), `prop` (Propagation).

## The Prime Directive
**Simulate the User.**
A coherent system that solves the wrong problem is a failure.

## Protocol

1.  **Protocol Audit**
    - Review recent agent actions/logs.
    - Compare against `AGENTS.md` (The "Constitution").
    - Are we following "The Exosuit Way"? (Phased Evolution, Living Context).

2.  **Drift Detection**
    - Read `docs/vision.md` (or the Mission Statement in `AGENTS.md`).
    - Read `docs/agent-context/plan.toml`.
    - **Question**: Does the current plan actually move us closer to the Vision? Or are we "bikeshedding" (focusing on trivial details)?

3.  **Course Correction**
    - If Drift is detected, propose a "Course Correction" task.
    - If the Agent is violating protocol, generate a "Correction Prompt" to realign behavior.

## Output
- Assessment of Alignment (On Track / Drifting).
- Proposals for realigning the Plan or Agent Behavior.
