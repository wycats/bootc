# Raise the soft file-descriptor limit for the user session bus.
#
# The default soft limit (1 024) is easily exhausted when heavy workloads
# inside a distrobox/toolbox container generate a burst of podman-exec
# D-Bus traffic.  Once dbus-broker hits EMFILE it can no longer accept
# connections, which cascades into gnome-shell crashing and GDM killing
# the session (hard logout).
#
# 524 288 matches the default used by most modern systemd services.
