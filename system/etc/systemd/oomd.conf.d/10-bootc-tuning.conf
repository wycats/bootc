# Defaults are 60%/30s. Tighten duration to 20s (Fedora workstation guidance).
# Keep the global pressure limit at 60% to avoid false positives on
# background services. Per-app slices override to 50% via
# ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit on their unit files.
DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=60%
DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=20s

# Keep swap monitoring at default 90%. With vm.swappiness=10, swap fills
# slowly — lowering this threshold risks premature kills during normal
# swap usage. The primary defense is PSI-based pressure, not swap level.
SwapUsedLimit=90%
